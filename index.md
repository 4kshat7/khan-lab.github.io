## Our Research and Team Highlights

{% capture text %}

Our research bridges computational biology, (epi)genomics, machine learning, and data science to understand gene regulation in diseases such as cancer. We publish high-impact research papers in leading journals across diverse topics from genomics, epigenomic, machine learning, cancer genomics, and science policy.
