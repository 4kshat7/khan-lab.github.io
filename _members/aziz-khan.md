Aziz is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Abu Dhabi. He has a PhD in Bioinformatics from Tsinghua University followed by a Postdoc at NCMM, University of Oslo His research bridges computational biology, genomics, epigenomics, machine learning, and software engineering to understand gene regulation in diseases such as cancer. He published high-impact peer-reviewed research papers in leading journals across diverse topics from genomics, epigenomic, machine learning, cancer, and science policy.

His lab develops and use cutting-edge open-source tools, methods, and resources to analyze, visualize, and interpret large-scale multi-omic and multi-ethnic data, and to understand gene regulation and decipher the role of the non-coding genome in advancing precision medicine.

Before joining MBZUAI, Aziz was a senior research scientist at Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University with Christina Curtis where he led a bioinformatics team and developed scalable infrastructure for analyzing large-scale cancer multi-omic datasets. He contributed to major multi-institutional consortiums, including the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) and the Metastasis Research Network (MetNet). At Stanford University he also served as an Instructor for Stanford Biosciences to develop and teach a course on the art of reproducible science.
