Aziz Khan is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at the Mohamed bin Zayed University of Artificial Intelligence (MBZUAI), Abu Dhabi. His research bridges computational biology, genomics, epigenomics, machine learning, and software engineering to understand gene regulation in diseases such as cancer. He published over 30 high-impact peer-reviewed research papers in leading journals across diverse topics from genomics, epigenomic, machine learning, cancer, and science policy.

His lab develops and use cutting-edge open-source tools, methods, and resources to analyze, visualize, and interpret large-scale multi-omic and multi-ethnic data, and to understand gene regulation and decipher the role of the non-coding genome in advancing precision medicine.

Prior joining MBZUAI, he was senior research scientist at Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University with Christina Curtis and also an Instructor for Stanford Biosciences. He has a PhD in Bioinformatics from Tsinghua University followed by a Postdoc at NCMM, University of Oslo.
