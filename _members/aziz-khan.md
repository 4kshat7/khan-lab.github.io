Aziz is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at [**MBZUAI**](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/aziz-khan/), leading the Computational Biology and Cancer Regulatory Genomics (**CBCRG**) Lab in Abu Dhabi. He has a PhD in Bioinformatics from Tsinghua University followed by a Postdoc at NCMM, University of Oslo. His research bridges computational biology, genomics, epigenomics, machine learning, and software engineering to understand gene regulation in diseases such as cancer.

Previously, Aziz was a senior research scientist at Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University with [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) where he led a bioinformatics team and developed scalable infrastructure for analyzing large-scale cancer multi-omic datasets. He contributed to major multi-institutional consortiums, including the [Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)](https://humantumoratlas.org/) and the [Metastasis Research Network (MetNet)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/dcb/research-programs/metnet). At Stanford University he also served as an Instructor for Stanford Biosciences to develop and teach a course on the art of reproducible science.

 He is a strong advocate for open, reproducible, and collaborative science. He has developed widely used bioinformatics tools and resources such as JASPAR, Intervene, dbSUPER, and UniBind, which have become essential resources in gene regulation. He is also a [Certified Instructor](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/) for The Carpentries, providing hands-on training in software and genomics data science. His commitment to open research is further demonstrated through his roles as an eLife and ASAPbio Community Ambassador, where he has actively promoted preprints, open-science, and reproducibility.
