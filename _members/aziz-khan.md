Aziz is an Assistant Professor of Computational Biology at [**MBZUAI**](https://mbzuai.ac.ae/study/faculty/aziz-khan/), leading the Computational Biology and Cancer Regulatory Genomics (**CBCRG**) Lab in Abu Dhabi. He has a PhD in Bioinformatics from Tsinghua University with [Xuegong Zhang](https://eca.xglab.tech/member/index.html) followed by a Postdoc at NCMM, University of Oslo with [Anthony Mathelier](https://mathelierlab.com/). His research bridges computational biology, genomics, epigenomics, machine learning, and software engineering to understand gene regulation in diseases such as cancer.

Previously, Aziz was a senior research scientist at Stanford Cancer Institute, Stanford University with [Christina Curtis](https://med.stanford.edu/curtislab.html) where he led a bioinformatics team and developed scalable infrastructure for analyzing large-scale cancer multi-omic datasets. He contributed to major consortiums, including the [Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN)](https://humantumoratlas.org/) and the [Metastasis Research Network (MetNet)](https://www.cancer.gov/about-nci/organization/dcb/research-programs/metnet). At Stanford University he also served as an [Instructor](https://explorecourses.stanford.edu/instructor/azizk) for Stanford Biosciences to develop and teach a course on the art of reproducible science.

 He is a strong advocate for open, reproducible, and collaborative science. He has developed widely used bioinformatics [tools and resources](/tools) such as JASPAR, Intervene, dbSUPER, and UniBind, which have become essential resources in gene regulation. He is also a [Certified Instructor](https://carpentries.org/community/instructors/){:target="_blank"} for The Carpentries, providing hands-on training in software and genomics data science. He was an eLife and ASAPbio Community Ambassador and  actively promoted preprints, open-science, and reproducibility.
